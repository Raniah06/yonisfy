## Why do I exist? :fire:

I know now maybe the only question you have is why **Yonisfy** exist and why he helps you what all he got for free, even without waiting for you to ask

in simple words we can say because that's the nature of **Yonisfy**, I know him a long time ago and can confirm this but to answer your question because at the time **Yonisfy** started programming, there were many things that I did not know, even the simplest things but after four, five, ten days or more and still my problem was not solved, and get stuck. I decided to go the war which I always hate before any question to overcome my shyness then finally, ASK, and here's a sample of the questions and answers:-

- **What are the best courses for web development?** _Sorry bro, I am busy_
- **What are the best articles?** _I don't know why you ask to find it yourself_
- **How can I ....?** _How does someone like you become a developer?_
- **What is the way to do this or that?** _:sweat: :disappointed_relieved: :cry:_

I reached the point that it made me think that sometimes I lose hope from those around me. Yes, my friend. I have gone through what you have gone through, and maybe more. And here I am. I will try with all I can to provide all the information you need. I will give you answers to the questions that will solve your problems. by providing

- **Roadmaps** :rocket:
- **Youtube Videos** :video_camera:
- **My notes on some technology** :computer:
- **How to prepare for an interview** :globe_with_meridians:
- **Free Consulting for any question you have** :snowboarder:

**In our simple language**, **Yonisfy** will give you the secret of craftsmanship :heart:

> The biggest passions in life for me are **people** and experiences. I hope **Yonisfy** can improve your life in some meaningful way and that you, in turn, can improve someone else's life to keep the circle closed.

> I love to teach. It's a challenging task that forces you to peel back all the knowledge you've gained so you can approach someone who lacks the same experience and terminology you have. It forces you to take amorphous concepts floating in your brain and crystalize them into solid concepts that you can describe. It forces you to acknowledge your gaps in knowledge because you'll begin to question things you know others will question. For me to ever master a concept, I have to teach it to someone else.
