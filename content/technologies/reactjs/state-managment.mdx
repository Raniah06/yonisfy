## State Management

In React, state refers to a structure that keeps track of how data changes over time in your application.

The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

### State Types

Let's know first [What are the types of State in React](http://jamesknelson.com/5-types-react-application-state/)

I think it will be a better idea after knowing the types of state is to know how to manage it. I will make a simple counter app and build it with different state management logic here's the [starter code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/state-management-starter-code-y7ke2) 💻 to be able to play with it

### Class-Based State

I need from you to think of the state as `plain object` which contain the some data. when a state property is `updated`, React `re-renders` the component accordingly.

In class components, there are two ways to initialize state:-

1. **Constructor function**

   - it's regular functions introduced in ES6, but there’s a common agreement to name them with capital letter first
   - it's the first function called in a class when it is first instantiated
   - when a new object is created from the class. Initializing the state within the constructor function allows the state object to be created before React renders the component.

   ```javascript
   class ClassComponent extends Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = {
         count: 0,
       };
     }
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Class property**
   - This enables defining class properties for your JavaScript classes. This can be particularly useful for React components. It combats messy things like binding event handlers in the constructor 🤢 u can read more about it from [here](https://codeburst.io/use-class-properties-to-clean-up-your-classes-and-react-components-93185879f688)

Both approaches net the same output so it all just comes down to preference. I’ll be sticking with the constructor function approach in our example. simply I need to create a simple counter with the ability to increment, decrement and reset. we will start basically by defining the `state` object with simple `count` property in the constructor function

```javascript
//...
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }
  //...
}
```

the above snippet maily tell react that we have property cause re-rendering every time it changes. so the question now is how we can change it what's the trigger.. as you say we need to define `click` handler to change. Don't worry i will do this for you and attached it to the buttons

```javascript
//..
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

+  increment() {
+    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
+  }

+  decrement () {
+    this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 });
+  };

+ reset() {
+    this.setState({ count: 0 });
+  }

  render() {
+    const { count } = this.state;
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">State Management Starter Code</header>
        <main>
+         <p className="count">{count}</p>
          <div className="controls">
+            <button className="primary" onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
+            <button className="danger" onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement</button>
+            <button className="info" onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>
          </div>
        </main>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

now every thing is good and sounds fine but if you try to press any button nothing will happen and you will get errors in the console and there's a reason for `this`, as you say it's `this` this is the problem. if you not familar with `this` in javascript I make a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZwgdgCigM&t=1459s) about it watch it now 😉 ... I am waiting you here don't worry

so now we need to overcome of the problem of binding a function to a component instance and this can be done by four different ways

```javascript
//..
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
+    // 1. Bind in Constructor (ES2015)
+    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
  }

+  // 2. Class Properties (Stage 3 Proposal)
+  decrement = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 });
  };

 reset() {
    this.setState({ count: 0 });
  }

  render() {
    const { count } = this.state;
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">State Management Starter Code</header>
        <main>
         <p className="count">{count}</p>
          <div className="controls">
+           {/* 3. Bind in Render */}
+           <button className="primary" onClick={this.increment.bind(this)}>Increment</button>
            <button className="danger" onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement</button>
            <button className="info" onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>
+           {/* 4. Arrow Function in Render */}
+           {/*<button className="primary" onClick={() => this.increment()}>Increment</button>*/}
          </div>
        </main>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

I see now it's working and you are happy, u can [read more](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-functions.html) but 
there's also something I need from you to pay attention to which is **asynchronicity** of `setState` function for example:-

```javascript
//...
 increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
}
//...
```

in the above example the `count -> 1` because react will queuing up state changes, and will batch them up then efficiently make that changes so underneath it will be something like

```javascript
Object.assign(
  {},
  yourFirstCallToSetState,
  yourSecondCallToSetState,
  yourThirdCallToSetState,
  yourFourthCallToSetState
);
```

which result merge them all and **the last one win**

one more thing we need to pay attention to that traditionally we pass `an object` to `setState` but we can pass other things like `function` and that function has some arguments the first one will be `state` and return an object with the new state, one more important think I need to hight here if we do the same multiple `setState` but with `function` version the result will be different

```javascript
//...
 increment() {
    this.setState(prevState => { return { count: prevState.count + 1 } });
    this.setState(prevState => { return { count: prevState.count + 1 } });
    this.setState(prevState => { return { count: prevState.count + 1 } });
    this.setState(prevState => { return { count: prevState.count + 1 } });
}
//...
```

in the above example the `count -> 4` because in this case react will not merge them like `objects` I know you can compose it but it's not the case don't be cleaver 😄 but function will give us the ability to add **condition** for example like

```javascript
//...
 increment() {
    let max = 5;
    this.setState((prevState) => {
      if (prevState.count >= max) return;
      return { count: prevState.count + 1 };
    });
//...
```

that's cool ha, but there's a situations u might need to do something after the state is updated. fortunately the react provide a solution for this situation by passing a callback function as second argument for `setState` method

```javascript
//...
increment() {
    let max = 5;
    this.setState(
      (prevState) => {
        if (prevState.count >= max) return;
        return { count: prevState.count + 1 };
      },
      () => {
        console.log("After!", this.state); // Count - 1
      }
    );
    console.log("Before!", this.state); // Count - 0
}
//...
```

<Info>
  ❓ Now after you understand how the use <strong>setState</strong> it's time to
  do some work{" "}

I need to update the title of the document everytime the state changes. even in increment, decrement or reset

// hint: use document.title
